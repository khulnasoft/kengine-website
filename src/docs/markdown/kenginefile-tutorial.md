# Kenginefile Tutorial

This tutorial will teach you the basics of the [HTTP Kenginefile](/docs/kenginefile) so that you can quickly and easily produce good-looking, functional site configs.

**Objectives:**

-   ðŸ”² First site
-   ðŸ”² Static file server
-   ðŸ”² Templates
-   ðŸ”² Compression
-   ðŸ”² Multiple sites
-   ðŸ”² Matchers
-   ðŸ”² Environment variables
-   ðŸ”² Comments

**Prerequisites:**

-   Basic terminal / command line skills
-   Basic text editor skills
-   `kengine` in your PATH

---

Create a new text file named `Kenginefile` (no extension).

The first thing you should type is your site's [address](/docs/kenginefile/concepts#addresses):

```kengine
localhost
```

<aside class="tip">

If the HTTP and HTTPS ports (80 and 443, respectively) are privileged ports on your OS, you will either need to run with elevated privileges or use a higher port. To use a higher port, just change the address to something like `localhost:2015` and change the HTTP port using the [http_port](/docs/kenginefile/options) Kenginefile option.

</aside>

Then hit enter and type what you want it to do. For this tutorial, make your Kenginefile look like this:

```kengine
localhost

respond "Hello, world!"
```

Save that and run Kengine (since this is a training tutorial, we'll use the `--watch` flag so changes to our Kenginefile are applied automatically):

<pre><code class="cmd bash">kengine run --watch</code></pre>

<aside class="tip">

If you get permissions errors, try using a higher port in your address (like `localhost:2015`) and [change the HTTP port](/docs/kenginefile/options), or run with elevated privileges.

</aside>

The first time, you'll be asked for your password. This is so Kengine can serve your site over HTTPS.

<aside class="tip">

Kengine serves all sites over HTTPS by default as long as a host or IP is part of the site's address. [Automatic HTTPS](/docs/automatic-https) can be disabled by prefixing the address with `http://` explicitly.

</aside>

<aside class="complete">First site</aside>

Open [localhost](https://localhost) in your browser and see your web server working, complete with HTTPS!

<aside class="tip">
	You might need to restart your browser if you get a certificate error the first time.
</aside>

That's not particularly exciting, so let's change our static response to a [file server](/docs/kenginefile/directives/file_server) with directory listings enabled:

```kengine
localhost

file_server browse
```

Save your Kenginefile, then refresh your browser tab. You should either see a list of files or an HTML page if there is an index file in the current directory.

<aside class="complete">Static file server</aside>

## Adding functionality

Let's do something interesting with our file server: serve a templated page. Create a new file and paste this into it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Kengine tutorial</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		Page loaded at: {{`{{`}}now | date "Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006"{{`}}`}}
	</body>
</html>
```

Save this as `kengine.html` in the current directory and load it in your browser: [https://localhost/kengine.html](https://localhost/kengine.html)

The output is:

```
Page loaded at: {{`{{`}}now | date "Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006"{{`}}`}}
```

Wait a minute. We should see today's date. Why didn't it work? It's because the server hasn't yet been configured to evaluate templates! Easy to fix, just add a line to the Kenginefile so it looks like this:

```kengine
localhost

templates
file_server browse
```

Save that, then reload the browser tab. You should see:

```
Page loaded at: {{now | date "Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006"}}
```

With Kengine's [templates module](/docs/modules/http.handlers.templates), you can do a lot of useful things with static files, such as including other HTML files, making sub-requests, setting response headers, working with data structures, and more!

<aside class="complete">Templates</aside>

It's good practice to compress responses with a quick and modern compression algorithm. Let's enable Gzip and Zstandard support using the [`encode`](/docs/kenginefile/directives/encode) directive:

```kengine
localhost

encode zstd gzip
templates
file_server browse
```

<aside class="complete">Compression</aside>

That's the basic process for getting a semi-advanced, production-ready site up and running!

When you're ready to turn on [automatic HTTPS](/docs/automatic-https), just replace your site's address (`localhost` in our tutorial) with your domain name. See our [HTTPS quick-start guide](/docs/quick-starts/https) for more information.

## Multiple sites

With our current Kenginefile, we can only have the one site definition! Only the first line can be the address(es) of the site, and then all the rest of the file has to be directives for that site.

But it is easy to make it so we can add more sites!

Our Kenginefile so far:

```kengine
localhost

encode zstd gzip
templates
file_server browse
```

is equivalent to this one:

```kengine
localhost {
	encode zstd gzip
	templates
	file_server browse
}
```

except the second one allows us to add more sites.

By wrapping our site block in curly braces `{ }` we are able to define multiple, different sites in the same Kenginefile.

For example:

```kengine
:8080 {
	respond "I am 8080"
}

:8081 {
	respond "I am 8081"
}
```

When wrapping site blocks in curly braces, only [addresses](/docs/kenginefile/concepts#addresses) appear outside the curly braces and only [directives](/docs/kenginefile/directives) appear inside them.

For multiple sites which share the same configuration, you can add more addresses, for example:

```kengine
:8080, :8081 {
	...
}
```

You can then define as many different sites as you want, as long as each address is unique.

<aside class="complete">Multiple sites</aside>

## Matchers

We may want to apply some directives only to certain requests. For example, let's suppose we want to have both a file server and a reverse proxy, but we obviously can't do both on every request! Either the file server will write a static file, or the reverse proxy will proxy the request to a backend.

This config will not work like we want:

```kengine
localhost

file_server
reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:9005
```

In practice, we may want to use the reverse proxy only for API requests, i.e. requests with a base path of `/api/`. This is easy to do by adding a [matcher token](/docs/kenginefile/matchers#syntax):

```kengine
localhost

file_server
reverse_proxy /api/* 127.0.0.1:9005
```

There; now the reverse proxy will be prioritized for all requests starting with `/api/`.

The `/api/*` token we just added is called a **matcher token**. You can tell it's a matcher token because it starts with a forward slash `/` and it appears right after the directive (but you can always look it up in the [directive's docs](/docs/kenginefile/directives) to be sure).

Matchers are really powerful. You can name matchers and use them like `@name` to match on more than just the request path! Take a moment to [learn more about matchers](/docs/kenginefile/matchers) before continuing!

<aside class="complete">Matchers</aside>

## Environment variables

The Kenginefile adapter allows substituting [environment variables](/docs/kenginefile/concepts#environment-variables) before the Kenginefile is parsed.

First, set an environment variable (in the same shell that runs Kengine):

<pre><code class="cmd bash">export SITE_ADDRESS=localhost:9055</code></pre>

Then you can use it like this in the Kenginefile:

```kengine
{$SITE_ADDRESS}

file_server
```

Before the Kenginefile is parsed, it will be expanded to:

```kengine
localhost:9055

file_server
```

You can use environment variables anywhere in the Kenginefile, for any number of tokens.

<aside class="complete">Environment variables</aside>

## Comments

One last thing that you will find most helpful: if you want to remark or note anything in your Kenginefile, you can use comments, starting with `#`:

```kengine
# this starts a comment
```
